- What I used for this project is below  
  * Server : https://github.com/SharkBSJ/bsj_mern_shopping
    * Because this project is Hybrid APP, you need a server (It's made using MERN Stack)
  * React-Native (Client, For Mobile APP)
  * Visual Studio Code (IDE)

- How to build  
  * Please Modify WEB_URL (in ./App.js) as Server Adderess (For Connection)
